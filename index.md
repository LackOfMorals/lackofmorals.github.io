# Work In Progress #

Memories, experiences and thoughts acquired ( and still doing so ) over the course of, lets say, many years and employment with several different organisations.  

My career has covered entering student enrollment data, Sysadmin in an educational setting, break fix , professional services, and marketing before sliding into Product Management, an area that I finally found my niche.  

Occasionally I write code to help my own understanding and educate others.  I completely own up to that code being on the 'value' than 'finest' end of the spectrum.

You may find content here useful, annoying, pointless or a combination of all three.

Your mileage may vary
