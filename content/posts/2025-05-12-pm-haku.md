If you find my usual writing hard to get on with, then consider the poems I that could attempt.

Your typical [Vogon](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Vogon_poetry) would consider them excessive and get back to destroying planets for much need bypasses.

So I asked a AI chat bot thingy to describe Product Management in the style of a Haku

- Features lost in launch
- Users want what isn't there
- Dreams meet reality

I think the AI must have been trained on Vogon prose.
