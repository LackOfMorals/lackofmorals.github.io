## Work In Progress

Dear Reader, 

This is a collection of memories, experiences, and thoughts acquired ( and still doing so ) over the course of, lets say, many years of employment with several different organisations.

My career has covered entering student enrollment data, Sysadmin in an educational setting, break fix , professional services, and marketing before sliding into Product Management where I finally found my niche.

Occasionally I write code to help my own understanding and educate others; code being on the ‘value’ than ‘finest’ end of the spectrum.

You may find content here useful, annoying, pointless or a combination of all three. In other words your mileage may vary
