Back in my youth, the BBC Micro appeared along with T.V Series to accompany it ( you could download code from the T.V picture and this was in the early 1980s !)  And I was hooked.  

BBC Micro computers ( 32kb ram , 6502 cpu - all 8bits of it ) were rolled out across in U.K schools and I used them extensively during my educational years.  Later on, after studying software engineering at Uni with Pascal and C on running ms-dos, I realised that my programming ambitions exceeded my ability but my fascination with I.T remained.  This led me into a number of jobs that took me on a journey across the computing landscape.  I supported a Novell NetWare based system at a local college and studied for my Certified NetWare Engineer before jumping into the commercial world as part of the maintenance team for a company that provided harware and software for Doctors.  

A few more positions at different organisations exposed me to numerous technologies, frameworks, scripting and a whole lot of new experiences that eventually took me into professional services before getting recruited into Pre-Sales and then Product Management.  

Now I could tap into the pool of experience I had acquired during all of my interactions with customers that from maintaining my interest in coding as part of the effort to deliver meaningful, usable, software. 

I had arrived at the end of one journey.

And departed on another one.
