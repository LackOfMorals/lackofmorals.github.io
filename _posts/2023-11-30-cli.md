# Sometimes using a CLI is the only way
We've become sooo used to having a graphical user interface with swipy user-friendly experiences that we've become remarkably complacent about the shadowy figures that lurk in the background, able to unleash their power at will[^1]. I am, of course, describing command line interfaces whose ability to perform simple and complex actions quickly is unrivalled.

Just be careful out there, with great power comes great responsibility; just ask anyone who has typed  _'rm -rf /'_ on a Unix based computer. [^2]


## Syntax Error: When Words Betray You
Let us move out of the cold, chilly, dark depths that my words have taken us to and into the lighter, warmer shallows with an eye on an appealing beach bar. 


There are times when a CLI gets you what you need without needing to push a pointer around a screen and click on things - it's way faster and more convenient. 


Consider using the Aura provisioning API [^3], Aura being a cloud based service for [Neo4j graph databases](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/).   You can read more on about Aura provisioning API in the [documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/api/specification/).


The API allows programmatic management of provisioning Aura instances - you can create, update and then, when you're done, delete them. 


You can use the API in code, an application like Postman or with a CLI - like curl. For example , use curl to list all of the Aura instances in your account


```Bash
curl -s -X 'GET' \
 'https://api.neo4j.io/v1/instances' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImFKbWhtUTlYeExsQmFLdHNuZnJIcCJ9eyJ1c3IiOiJkNzI2MzE1My03MWZmLTUxMjQtOWVjYy1lOGFlM2FjNjNjZWUiLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2F1cmEtYXBpLmV1LmF1dGgwLmNvbS8iLCJzdWIiOiJvVXI4WkN5SjhyNmhwUU9CSmFDTVJGSVFrTVo3RktLVEBjbGllbnRzIiwiYXVkIjoiaoijojHR0cHM6Ly9jb25zb2xlLm5lbzRqLmlvIiwiaWF0IjoxNzAxMTAxMzY2LCJleHAiOjE3MDExMDQ5NjYsImF6cCI6Im9VcjhaQ3lKOHI2aHBRT0JKYUNNUkZJUWtNWjdGS0tUIiwiZ3R5IjoiY2xpZW50LWNyZWRlbnRpYWxzIn0.7MtrY2HKjTRJonE9fHAt97peeLqniGm03m7rq5J9Imy8Liem3-kF0Cvi_SmKe-sut943RHQ47Q_RjyYCZ3Y58a7IYH27;lkj;iojREX6hI6Tz3bI8E2WlpSHDg4OJ0i9z6XMFrbOpKsu6uWYQyLLleVCOtpzqg1ManZnotsI5Krw9rKPBJAoV_EUMFYeMmbVbH7UMKry_ogi15zrhmSZTHYeU1YBkPC_vYmhWc6fBj7flt04A4SyzyG5ITYuzCFuNiECsA6T3acCQRAUbFLngMszYu1RFg'
```


Which will return JSON like this


```json
{
 "data": [
   {
     "cloud_provider": "gcp",
     "id": "4980872a",
     "name": "Instance01",
     "tenant_id": "6e6bbbe2-1234-5f8a-a25f-b1f62f08b98f"
   },
   {
     "cloud_provider": "gcp",
     "id": "601d53a3",
     "name": "Instance02",
     "tenant_id": "6e6bbbe2-1234-5f8a-a25f-b1f62f08b98f"
   },
   {
     "cloud_provider": "gcp",
     "id": "713adeb0",
     "name": "Instance03",
     "tenant_id": "6e6bbbe2-2345-5f8a-a25f-b1f62f
```

Curl is a great tool with many strengths but it is not focused on provisioning activities in Aura; this results in a user experience that is not as good as it could be.

If only someone could wave a magic wand and take us to a place where CLIs for Aura danced and gambled amongst the rippling waves of flowers in the fields soaked in the rays of summer [^4]


## Efficiency Unleashed

Why hello there Aura API, a CLI for use with , err, Aura. It brings the ability to provision Aura instances and manage their lifecycle programmatically.  If you're comfortable at the command line or want to include Aura in cloud formation templates or terraform scripts, then this is for you.


Aura CLI is currently a [Neo4j Labs project](https://neo4j.com/labs/aura-cli/ ) written in Python.  This means that you can wave your own magic wand and suggest code improvements - 'Codify' as Harry P would say whilst waving his wood around. 


We're going to see how it goes for the next few months before we take any decision but, based on feedback so far, there's a fair to good chance that Aura CLI will become an official Neo4j product [^5].


Let us take a quick peek into what it can do 



## Learn by Doing

Install the Aura CLI with

```bash
pip install aura-cli 
```

Once that's done, and it only takes a few moments, you're then able to confirm that the installation was successful

```bash
aura --version
```

API commands are divided into 3 resources: instances, tenants and snapshots. Use the --help flag to get more information about each subcommand, e.g.


```bash
aura instances --help
Usage: aura instances [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Manage your Aura instances

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create     Create a new instance
  delete     Delete an instance
  get        Get details for an instance
  list       List all instances in a tenant
  overwrite  Overwrite an instance
  pause      Pause an instance
  resume     Resume an instance
  update     Update an instance
```

I should have mentioned this a bit earlier but you will need a client id and client secret which you obtain from the Aura console by clicking on your account and following the UX 

Nip off, do that and come back.  I'll wait.

With the client id and client secret use them like this

```bash
aura credentials add --name <NAME> --client-id <YOUR_CLIENT_ID> --client-secret <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET> --use
```
This tells the Aura CLI what credentials to use with the Aura API

Now you can use the various commands.  For example, show the Aura instances in a table

```bash
aura instances list --output table

cloud_provider | id       | name                        | tenant_id                           
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aws            | aab68676 | Instance01                  | cdd08005-1f34-57e0-abc6-9f1d813f7301
gcp            | bbe0632f | Instance02                  | cdd08005-1f34-57e0-abc6-9f1d813f7301
aws            | 3djfi676 | Instance03                  | cdd08005-1f34-57e0-abc6-9f1d813f7301

```

How about creating a new instance?  

First, you'll need to know what configurations are available.  These can be different to each tenant you belong to in Aura.  This will be a two step process - get the list of tenants and then get the configurations for the tenant where you want to create an instance.

Get the tenants
```bash
aura tenants list --output table
id                                   | name          
-----------------------------------------------------
a4dd8fc3-a16d-5734-a5e3-1f2e465ddd2b | Tenant1
cdd08005-1234-57e0-abc6-9f1d813f7301 | Tenant2     

```
Now the configurations for Tenant1 using its tenant id

Caution - this will be a long list and I've only shown a snip in the example

```bash
aura tenants get -id a4dd8fc3-a16d-5734-a5e3-1f2e465ddd2b
{
  "id": "a4dd8fc3-a16d-5734-a5e3-1f2e465ddd2b",
  "instance_configurations": [
    {
      "cloud_provider": "gcp",
      "memory": "2GB",
      "region": "europe-west1",
      "region_name": "Belgium (europe-west1)",
      "type": "enterprise-db",
      "version": "4"
    },

```

You can then use this information to create an instance.

```bash
aura instances create -tid a4dd8fc3-a16d-5734-a5e3-1f2e465ddd2b -cp gcp -t enterprise-db -r europe-west1 -m 4 -v 5 -n Instance10
{
  "cloud_provider": "gcp",
  "connection_url": "neo4j+s://5c45c43b.databases.neo4j.io",
  "id": "5c45c43b",
  "name": "Instance10",
  "password": "PWP6UZHNEGkaZEBj5c9N1PYqfNRMf0jsCBKWgCt874U",
  "region": "europe-west1",
  "tenant_id": "a4dd8fc3-a16d-5734-a5e3-1f2e465ddd2b",
  "type": "enterprise-db",
  "username": "neo4j"
}

```

It will take a few moments to create the new instance.  You can check progress like so

```bash
aura instances get -id 5c45c43b
{
  "cloud_provider": "gcp",
  "connection_url": "neo4j+s://5c45c43b.databases.neo4j.io",
  "id": "5c45c43b",
  "memory": "4GB",
  "name": "Instance01",
  "region": "europe-west1",
  "status": "running",
  "storage": "8GB",
  "tenant_id": "a4dd8fc3-a16d-5734-a5e3-1f2e465ddd2b",
  "type": "enterprise-db"
}
```

When status changes to running , the instance is available

## The sun rays warms our skin
The default JSON output can be consumed by other applications for subsequent processing so you can start to sequence operations together.  Or, if you're just lazy like me, place it into scripts to spin up and down Aura instances without having to move a mouse around the screen.

Enjoy

Until the next time, laters
