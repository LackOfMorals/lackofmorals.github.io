# Explicit transactions with Neo4j Query API on Aura

When we launched the Query API for Neo4j, it executed a Cypher statement as implicit transaction.  This is where the Query API took care of the transaction handling.  We always intended providing the ability for users of the API to control the lifecycle of the transaction - create, commit, rollback - within which Cypher statements are executed. This is referred to as an Explicit Transaction.

Over the last few months, we've been working hard ( I say we - I've just drank tea and ate biscuits , the engineers have done all of the hard work ) to add support for Explicit Transactions to the Query API and I'm pleased to say that this will be available soon.

You use explicit transactions to group together related queries which work together to achieve a single logical database operation. For example, adding a new movie, actors and directors can be seen as a single logical operation.

As Neo4j is ACID compliant, queries within a transaction will either be executed as a whole or not at all: you cannot get a part of the transaction succeed and another fail.

You should also be aware that , once created, a transaction does not exist forever.  There's time limit of 30 seconds before it expires.

Query API uses the same workflow as for any other transaction with Neo4j

- Begin a transaction.
- Perform database operations.
- Commit or roll back the transaction.

Remember that transactions are all or nothing. When trying a Commit or Delete ( rollback ) these can only be succesful if every single database operation was also succfessful.  If any database operation failed then the transaction itself fails.  As a result a subsequent commit or delete attempt will also fail; effectively the transaction never happened.

The Query API has an extend path for transactions that works like this

- /tx
A POST operation to this path will return a tx id in the response.
- /tx/{tx id}
A POST operation to this path with a transacton id is used for database operations
- /tx/{tx id}/commit
A POST operation to this path with a transacton id is used to commit database operations.

- /tx/{tx id}
A DELETE option to this path  will rollback all database operations for the given transaction id

Explicit transaction with Aura work slightly differently when compared to self-managed single Neo4j DB or self-managed Neo4j DB Cluster.  The lifecycle of a transaction is managed by a single Neo4j DB.  In order to maintain this in Aura, a header key:value pair is returned in the response from the initial request to /tx along with the tx id in the request body.  The key:value pair is then used in all subsequent requests during the lifecycle of the transactions which ensures correct routing.

For self managed customers

- A single Neo4j DB installation does not need anything configuring to use explicit transactions with Query API
- A Neo4j DB Cluster will need configuration work.  This will be the subject of a follow-on blog entry.

## Explicit transactions with Aura

Lets take a scenario of adding a new movie and it's actors.  We'll use very simple Python to illustrate how this works.  I've added inline comments to explain what's going on.  

**Note:** This is structured to help show how this feature works.  It's really not a best practice example of how to do this!

**.env file**  Create a .env file in the same folder as this Python script will run.  The .env file should have the following content. Change the values to match your own Aura setup.

```Text
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://FQDN_TO_AURA_INSTANCE
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=AURA_INSTANCE_PASSWORD
```

```Python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

class MyConfiguration():
    """
    Reads configuration from .env file in the same folder as this Python file
    """
    load_dotenv()
    NEO4J_URI = os.getenv('NEO4J_URI')
    NEO4J_USERNAME = os.getenv('NEO4J_USERNAME')
    NEO4J_PASSWORD = os.getenv('NEO4J_PASSWORD')
    AURA_INSTANCEID = os.getenv('AURA_INSTANCEID')
    AURA_INSTANCENAME = os.getenv('AURA_INSTANCENAME')
